            In this School, we're brothers and sisters.
            In this School, we learn to pray,
            For God is our true Father
            And Guides us on our way.
            <br> <span>
                Chorus: </span> <br> <span>
                Oh, it's fine, it's grand, it's marvelous
                St. Xavier's Gold and Blue!
                We learn to serve our fellow-men
                For God and country too.
                Rich and Poor, we come together
                Lending all a helping hand,
                People of all religions
                As one family we stand.
                Our School is a place of learning
                But it gives us as we put in,
                It molds and builds our character
                To face the world and win. </span> <br> <span>
